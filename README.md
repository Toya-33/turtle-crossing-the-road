# turtle-crossing-the-road
It is a game where you are a turtle and you're trying to cross the road without getting hit by a car. It's pretty fun project to build.
## What I learn from this project:
- Know how to use object-oriented class to build different objects such as the cars, the turtle and scoreboard in order to incorporate them and make a game.
- Learn how to divide a big project into doable chunks of small tasks and objectives.
